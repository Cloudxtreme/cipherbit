* Intro
  This is the scrum board for Cipherbit. It uses a simple subset of
  features in [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] to track current and upcoming work.
* Ideas
** Attachments
   - Array attached to body?
   - Interesting: this is an entirely client-side feature
** Create Chrome/Firefox extension to provide secure delivery for web client code
   Both support extension signing, alleviating the need to trust the server
** Encrypt private key in localStorage
   - Sessionstore to store encryption credentials for private key
   - Symmetric encryption for private key using hash of password
   - This requires careful design and large UI changes
** Max message size
   - Limit the body to something sane
   - Investigate performance issue of non-indexed wide columns (~1MB)
** Address book encrypted and synced with server
* Todo
** Use guids instead of integers for public message IDs
   Integer IDs expose lots of information about the messages table
** Experiment with React on client-side
   - [[https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails][react-rails]] looks like a good starting point, and supports Coffeescript
** Add nonce endpoint                                                   :api:
** Enforce signed nonces                                       :api:security:
** Add nonce support to authenticate inbox/message views       :web:security:
** Make web interface responsive                                        :web:
   - Should be usable on mobile/tablet
** Inbox pagination support                                             :web:
** Filter source and destination key in the logs
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   You can filter certain request parameters from your log files by
   appending them to config.filter_parameters in the application
   configuration. These parameters will be marked [FILTERED] in the
   log.

   config.filter_parameters << :password
   #+END_EXAMPLE
* Doing
** Add web client unit tests                                    :testing:web:
* Done
** Remove unit test JS from production JS payload               :web:testing:
** Check signatures on sent messages                           :api:security:
